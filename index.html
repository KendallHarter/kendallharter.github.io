         wow here's the cool text this took way too much effort and probably
         doesn't even look that good.  Oh well, at least it's the basis for
         building something better.

      <input type="checkbox" id="test2" class="button">
      <label for="test2" class="label-test">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press here to see some different text</label>
      <div>
         This text is not very cool but it shows that the CSS can be reused.
